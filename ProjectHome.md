The main objective of the project is to centralize and automate the functions of a foreign exchange system in a way that it is extensible and is easy to deploy. User levels must be well defined, as to properly denote which functions are available to a specific user class. Another objective is to help the user to make decisions and how to implement certain business schemes by providing a definite and up to date data in graphical form. The system should be easy to use and is capable of total management: ensuring minimal use of the user's resources. It is also provided that the system, through appropriate technology and frameworks, will require minimal maintenance and maximum performance.
